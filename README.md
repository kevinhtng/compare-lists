# Compare Lists & Investment Dashboard

This project is a small web application I built to automate a task I was assigned at work and to stay updated on investment news and industry leaders. I leveraged AI to help streamline development and ensure the code was maintainable and efficient.

## Purpose

- **Automate File Comparison:** Initially, this repository was created to automate comparing two lists or files and quickly identify missing items, duplicates, or overlaps. Instead of manually checking line by line, the app highlights:
  - Items only in List A
  - Items only in List B
  - Items present in both lists

- **Stay Up-to-Date:** Since I visit this site daily, I added features to keep me informed about:
  - **Investment News:** Fetches the latest headlines from multiple financial news RSS feeds.
  - **Gartner Magic Quadrant Leaders:** Highlights companies leading in cloud and strategic technology sectors, including AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. Includes basic financial data like stock price, market cap, and P/E ratio.

## Features

- **Compare Lists:** Quickly find differences and overlaps between two lists or pasted text.
- **Instagram JSON Upload:** Extract usernames from exported JSON files to automatically populate lists.
- **Dark Mode:** Optional dark mode for a comfortable viewing experience.
- **Investment News Feed:** Pulls top stories from MarketWatch, Investopedia, and Reuters.
- **Magic Quadrant Dashboard:** Displays current leaders with fundamental stock data and post information.
- **Automatic Updates:** News updates every 5 minutes; Magic Quadrant refresh every 6 hours.
- **Keyboard Shortcut:** Press Ctrl+Enter (or Cmd+Enter on Mac) to run comparisons quickly.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- **Data Sources:** RSS feeds, Yahoo Finance API
- **AI Assistance:** Used AI to help structure the project, generate cleaner code, and ensure efficiency in handling data.

## Why I Built This

I wanted to:

1. Save time on repetitive work by automating file comparisons.  
2. Keep a daily dashboard with investment news and key company performance indicators.  
3. Showcase my ability to leverage AI to build practical tools that solve real-world problems.
